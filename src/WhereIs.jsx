It also serves as a place to find out what's here that maybe you didn't even think about.  If it's not listed, just shoot us an email and we will get back to you as soon as we can.</p>

                The closet on the far right in the upstairs loft has all of our games stacked up.  Puzzles as well... help yourself to anything in this closet and enjoy.  We plan to continually expand our little collection as it's a mainstay for our trips when we want to stay in.

                There are two haevy duty ones and one small one.  One is in the loft closet upstairs to the right, another is in the closet under the stairs.  The "normal" one can be found in the kitchen drawer on the far right cabinet.

                There is a folding card table in the closet under the stairs that you're welcome to (with 4 chairs).  We also have 3 folding chairs in the upstairs loft closet (far right).  You may also wish to move the table in the loft down to accommodate more kitcehn seating and that is totally fine.  Just be careful as to not scratch up the walls while moving items.

                The grill does not have a push-button igniter so you need to use a match or a lighter.  In the cabinet to the left of the fridge, the top drawer has some click-lighters.

                Check in the drawers beneath the loft TV.  It's a USB 3.0 drive and can be connected to the back of the modem (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't) or directly to a USB port on one of the TVs.  The Sony seems to have the most issues so I'd recommend using one of the Roku TVs.  I also want to mention: please be courteous and do not copy or otherwise damage the drive so that we can continue to offer it to our guests.
